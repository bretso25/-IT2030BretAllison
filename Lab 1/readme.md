<h2>Bret's Pet Grooming Services</h2>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Bret's Pet Grooming Services is responsible for providing exceptional grooming care services, techniques, and styles to a variety of dog breeds. The goal with the site is that users will be able to come to the site, choose their required service and setup an appointment. They can either pay then or pay after the service. The formula is like a PetSmart or Petco. When I retire, I'd like to do something with pets like a grooming service or animal sanctuary.</p>
