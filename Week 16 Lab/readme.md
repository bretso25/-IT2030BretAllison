<h1>Week 16 Lab>
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
*In your Readme.md file in your Week 16 folder in GitHub, list three things you learned in ASP.NET Core MVC web programming course. Be specific and include a brief description with details.<br><br>

There are quite a few things I've learned while working with ASP.Net Core MVC:
1.  One thing I'm pretty good at is greating new pages on the site or views.  These are bascially the pages that everyone will see on the site. To create a new page you can either copy an existing one by using copy, then paste, or you can right click on the folder (Home) > Add > New Items > and choose an option with .cshtml<br>
2.  Also, setting up a controller or class is pretty important.  A controller class is normally a class part of the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern. A controller basically controls the flow of the data. It controls the data flow into model object and updates the view whenever data changes.  To create a new one you can again right click on the Controllers folder > Add > New Item > Class.
3.  Anothe important piece of visual stuido is editing the modules area.  A model can help you visualize the world in which your system works, clarify users' needs, define the architecture of your system, analyze the code, and ensure that your code meets the requirements.  In a few of the models I created, the models contained the code necessary for the forms to work.  For example, my Customer.cs file contains all the code to validate the Support Form that we created last lab.

3 Things I would like to improve in my application would be:
1.  I would like to clean up some of the backend functionality for it.  For example, the debugger or troubleshooter start program link says Lab3.  I've tried changing this a few times, but it always messes things up.  Along with that, in the right hand bar it says Lab9.  I've tried changing this a few times too, but It also seems to mess things up.  Then alson in the right hand ba it says solution 'Lab5' (1 of 1 project).  I would like to get these to match the current lab or solution that I'm working on.  I'm sure these are easy changes, I think that changing them requies you to update a few other spots.  I'll work on learning this.

*List three things you would like to improve in your application. Be specific and include a brief description with details.<br>
*Make a copy of your Week 14 lab files and using the copy, make 3 style updates to your application. Use Bootstrap for your styling updates. Specify the filename(s) that has the updates and specify the style updates as well in your Readme.md file.<br>
*Upload your completed files to your Week 16 lab folder in GitHub and submit your link in Blackboard.
