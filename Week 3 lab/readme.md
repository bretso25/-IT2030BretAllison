<h2>Week 3 Lab</h2>
I've hopefully uploaded my lab 3 files correctly to GitHub.  I just zipped it up.  Is there a better way to upload the needed files?<br>
Also, I just wanted to say I appreciated the call about the Lab 3 question and answers.  With your help, I was able to figure out everything I was missing.
