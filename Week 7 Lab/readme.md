<h1>Week 7  Lab.  Troubleshooting a solution</h1>
<h2>Lab Instructions</h2>
For this lab you will debug the Tip Calculator app that is provided for you in the TipCalculatorWk7 folder. 
- In your Readme.md file in your Week 7 lab folder, list and identify all errors that you find. <br>
- Specify which file had the errors and what the error was and state what you did to fix the error.<br>
- Use the Error List window to find and correct any syntax errors that display when you try to run the app. Be sure to write down the errors as you encounter them. You can put comments in your code to help you keep track of the errors.<br>
- Use the Internal Server Error page and its stack trace to find and correct any unhandled exceptions that occur when you run the app.<br>
- Set a breakpoint in the model class and step through its code to find the error that leads to the app calculating an incorrect tip amount.<br>
- Use the Developer Tools (as shown below) to find and correct the CSS issue that prevents the label elements from displaying with the expected width.<br>
Submit the link to your corrected TipCalculatorWk7 project files.<br>
<h2>Lab Notes</h2>
<h3>This was a nice little troubleshooting lab. I believe I have all the asks for this lab noted below.</h3>

Attempting to run the app gives you build errors pop up.  In the Errors list I get these errors:

- CS1002 ;expected , **File** TipCalculator.cs
<br>To fix the TipCalculator.cs, I add a semicolon here.  return tip; <br>
- CS0161 'HomeController.Index()':not all code paths return a value, **File** HomeController.cs
<br>To fix this line we need to add a return value.  I added return View(); and was finally able to get the solution to run.
- CS0103 The name 'Viewbag' does not exist in the current context,   **File** HomeController.cs
<br>To fix this you needed to change Viewbag to ViewBag.  Names are case sensitive. ViewBag.TwentyFive = 0;<br>
- "widht" is not a known CSS property name. **File** site.css

<br>After getting the app to run, I get these errors on the internal server error page.
- line 15 <lable>@ViewBag.Fifteem.ToString("c2")</label>
- line 6  <div asp-validation-summary="All"></div>
<br>Both of these errors refer to the Index.cshtml file</br>
<br>The Index.cshtml file has a couple other spelling errors:
-       <label>@ViewBag.**Twety**.ToString("c2")</label>  
-        <label>@ViewBag.**TwentyFeve**.ToString("c2")</label> 

<br>I set a breakpoint at the var tip = MealCost.Value * percent; and saw that the calculation was dividing the percent instead of multiplying.  I changed the line var tip = MealCost.Value **/** percent; to var tip = MealCost.Value * percent;
<br>The css error was easy enough to fix using Developer Tools on chrome.  I use this quite a bit with my current job.  We just needed to correct **widht** to **width**
