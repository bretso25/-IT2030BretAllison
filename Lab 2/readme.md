Week 3 Lab
Steps to start and submit the lab:
Create a folder for Week 3 lab in your GitHub repository for this course.
Include a Readme.md file in your Week 3 lab folder. The contents of your Week3 Lab/Readme.md would be a summary of your lab.
In Blackboard submit a link to your GitHub Week 3 Lab when you have completed your lab.
Week 3 Lab Directions:
You will build an application for the retail category that you selected in Week 1 lab.
You are to use the same name that you picked for your retail application in Week 1 lab.
In Visual Studio, start a web application that is based on the MVC template.
Use the MVC pattern. To do that, create a model class that stores the subtotal and tax percent and calculates the tax amount and total. Make sure to bind that model to the Razor view that displays the page. (See attached sample image below)
Use a Razor layout to store the <html>, <head>, and <body> elements.
Use a custom CSS style sheet to style the HTML elements. You can use the one from the textbook on page 65, figure 2-14.
When your app starts, it should display your retail store page with the name of your store and the following labels: Subtotal, Tax percent, Tax Amount, and Total. There should be no subtotal or tax percent displayed, and it should set the tax amount and total to $0.00. (See attached sample image below)
If the user enters a valid subtotal and tax percent and clicks the Calculate button, the app should calculate and display the tax amount and total.
If the user enters invalid data and clicks the Calculate button, the app should display a summary of validation errors above the form.
Here are the requirements for valid data:
The sales price is required and must be a valid number that's greater than 0.
The tax percent is required and must be a valid number from 0 to 10
If the user clicks the Clear link, the app should reset the form to how it was when the app first started.
Upload your files to your Week 3 lab folder in GitHub and submit your link in Blackboard.
