In this course, we will develop web applications using ASP.NET Core MVC. We will design and create dynamic server-side websites, use client-side programming techniques in combination with server-side programming, design and write programs applying critical thinking and appropriate programming techniques as they apply to a web programming framework and apply database manipulation techniques to create dynamic database-driven web requests and responses.  Visual Studio also known as VS will be used to develop ASP.NET Core MVC applications throughout the semester to apply the concepts covered during the course. Prior knowledge of C# , HTML, and CSS is required for this course.
